## Online Lessons
We will work through two codecademy courses, [Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) and
[Learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css). Checkout the [schedule](Schedule.pdf) to find
out what sections you should have completed before each class.

## Stuck? Have a Question?
- Join the [MilSpouseCoders Study Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MilSpouseCodersStudyGroup/?source_id=891215057608259).
  This is a friendly community of other military spouses, veterans, and dependents. It is the perfect place to go when you
  don't know where or how to ask your question!
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a giant bank of Q&As specifically about coding! Start by searching to see if
  anyone has asked your question before. If not, submit your own and someone will probably answer within a few hours! Keep your
  eye out for question suggestions as you write up your own question - you just might find that someone has already asked it!
- The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) are the best place to go when you want to know the details
  of a specific HTML element or CSS property. How do I fill out an anchor tag? What were the options for the CSS position
  propety? The MDN Web Docs are the perfect place to go when you have questions like these - that is you know the name of the
  element or property in question and need a refresher on how to use it.
- Remember you can always Google your question! Maybe someone wrote an article or a blog post about your exact problem. Or
  this might just serve as a quick way to get to the exact Stack Overflow question or MDN reference page that you need :)
