# Week 4

- To get more comfortable with adjusting the position of elements, we recommend that you read the
  [CSS-Tricks - position](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/) article for review and as you read,
  use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) to test out the different settings.
- Another popular way to position HTML elements is using the flex-box properties. Again, CSS-Tricks has a great article on
  [flex-box properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Again, we recommend that you practice using
  flexbox right after reading the article. You could use it to position elements in your project, you could use
  [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), or try out [this fun froggy game](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) where use flex-box properties
  to move frogs around on a game board.
