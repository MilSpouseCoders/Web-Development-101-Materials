# Week 1

## What We Did Today
1. **Sign up for Codecademy.** We will work through two of their coures:
   [Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) and [Learn CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css). The
   [schedule](https://github.com/MilSpouseCoders/Web-Development-101-Materials/blob/master/Schedule.pdf) outlines what lessons you should have completed before each class. In class each week, we will
   take what you've learned and apply it to a personal project.
2. **Select a text editor** and then download, install, and configure it. We recommend [atom](https://atom.io/). If you chose
   Atom, it's a good idea to read over the article
   [Atom Basics](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/atom-basics/).
   
   An alternative is to sign up for and use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). This is a good option if you will be using multiple
   computers to work on your project, or you will be using a library (or borrowed) computer.
3. **Start thinking about your project.** When we meet next week, we'll start working on projects, so you'll want to have one
   picked out by then. Some ideas we talked about:
     - blog
     - mock website for a local business, non-profit, or other organization
     - a welcome guide for families that are new to the base
     - copy-cat site (try to replicate a site that you are familiar with)
     - something related to a hobby (or work)
     - a tribute page for something you're passionate about (basically a book report in website format with links and stuff)
4. **Join the [MilSpouseCoders Study Group] on Facebook.** This is a great place to get help if you get stuck and don't want to wait until the next class.
