# Week 2

## What We Did Today
1. Discussed pain points:
  - Did anyone get stuck at any point when doing the Codecademy lessons? How did you resolve your issues?
  - Is there anything that didn't make sense to you that you'd like to discuss further?
2. Start Projects
  - Amanda showed her project as an example
  - Atom snippets: Open a new HTML document in Atom and type "html" and then hit tab. Neat, right?! This works with other
    snippets of HTML too (as well as other languages).
  - Where to start?
    - focus on a homepage for now (most people name this file "index.html")
    - review the document you created in "Learn HTML: Elements and Structure"
      (or not! if you already know how you want to structure your homepage content, go for it!)
  - preview your webpage as you go by opening the file with your web browser
